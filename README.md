A Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix movies released in the 1990s. You‚Äôll dive into a rich dataset of titles, filter for 1990s movies, and uncover insights on durations, genre‚Äêspecific patterns, and more.

## üìå Project Overview

Netflix, founded in 1997, evolved from DVD rentals into a streaming giant. This notebook is part of a production‚Äêcompany research effort focusing on **nostalgic 1990s movies**. We perform EDA to understand:

- How many Netflix movies were released in the 1990s  
- Duration patterns (mean, median, mode, min/max)  
- Most common duration  
- Prevalence of short (<‚Äâ90¬†min) Action movies

## üìÇ Dataset: `netflix_data.csv`

A comma‚Äêseparated file containing metadata for all Netflix titles.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The analysis notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) follows these steps:

1. **Load libraries & data**  
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   df = pd.read_csv("netflix_data.csv")

2. Filter 1990s movies
   ```python
   movies = df[(df['type'] == 'Movie') & (df['release_year'] >= 1990) & (df['release_year'] <= 1999)]

3. Count total movies in 1990s
   ```python
   print(f"Total number of movies in the 1990s: {len(movies)}")

4. Compute duration stats
   ```python
   movies['duration_minutes'] = movies['duration']
   print(movies['duration_minutes'].describe())

5. Plot histogram
   ```python
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   plt.hist(movies['duration_minutes'].dropna(), bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
   plt.title('Distribution of Movie Durations (1990s)')
   plt.xlabel('Duration (minutes)')
   plt.ylabel('Number of Movies')
   plt.show()

6. Find most common duration
   ```python
   most_common_duration = movies['duration_minutes'].mode()[0]
   duration = int(most_common_duration) 
   print(f"Most common movie duration in the 1990s: {duration} minutes")

7. Short Action movies (<¬†90¬†min)
   ```python
   short_action_movies = movies[(movies['duration_minutes'] < 90) & (movies['genre'].str.contains('Action', na=False, case=False))]
   short_movie_count = len(short_action_movies)
   print(f"Number of short action movies (less than 90 minutes): {short_movie_count}")
